## The Project

1. Random points are generated and plotted as follows:
```{r}
set.seed(123); n=100 ;x = 1:n
y= rnorm(n,mean=.1*x,sd=1) *x +   rnorm(n,mean=1.8*x,sd=40)
plot(x,y)
```

2. The user is invited to draw a regression line
3. Clicking the Submit button will show the true regression line

--- .class #id 

## Instructions

1.  Move the slider to change the slope of the line
2.  Click the up/down buttons to move the intercept of the line.

---

## Purpose

1.  Show the intuition behind linear regression
2.  Allow the user to play with the data

---

## Future Development

1.  Show points that are heavily skewed.
2.  Go to three dimensions
